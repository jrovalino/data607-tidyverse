# How to use dplr-tidyverse

## dplyr package

 A fast, consistent tool for working with data frame like objects,
both in memory and out of memory

Decided to use a dataset found in Kaggle for US Breweries.

Main file breweries_us.csv contains all of the data in tabular format. Most of the data should be there, but occasionally a website is missing. Possible duplicates.

##Columns
brewery_nameName of brewery
typeType of establishment
addressBrewery Address
websiteWebsite address for the brewery
stateState the brewery is located in
state_breweriesNumber of breweries in this state
